        <h2>Biography:Why I joined Altschool Africa, my goals for the School of Engineering program</h2>
        <p>As a young agriculture graduate in Nigeria, I quickly encountered a harsh truth that few ever bother to discuss: a hard-earned “good” degree doesn't always guarantee a good job in a sector still fighting to catch up with the rest of the world. Facing this reality, I carved my own path into small-scale vegetable farming. A venture that plunged me into the brutal challenges of primary production in the Nigerian food industry, challenges that unexpectedly steered my life in a completely new direction towards technology.</p>
        <p>My initial farming ambition faced immediate setbacks, including a devastating fire that destroyed my crops and crucial irrigation equipment. It was during this tough period, while scrambling for funding, that a friend introduced me to decentralized finance. What began as a means to make ends meet soon blossomed into incredible opportunities within the Web3 ecosystem.<br> I contributed as a community manager to projects like Fame on Algorand, connecting farmers directly to markets, and Wayru on Solana, focused on decentralized internet for underserved communities.<br> These experiences were truly eye-opening for me, revealing innovative ways to solve real-world problems using modern technology and the “magic” of decentralization (LOL). This sparked a burning desire within me to learn programming. However, the sheer physical demands of farming consumed almost all my time and energy, leaving little room to properly focus on such technical concepts, which often made me feeling like I wasn't learning anything at all without dedicated guidance.</p>
        <p>Then, tragedy struck again. A second, even more devastating fire completely wiped out my entire harvest, making further farming impossible. This crushing blow, while financially crippling, gave me an invaluable gift: time. With my main source of income gone and essentially unemployed, a disaster kind of became a blessing in disguise. I finally had the dedicated time to fully immerse myself in my journey to become a programmer. Despite significant financial limitations, my determination to acquire these skills led me to AltSchool Africa School of Engineering, where I believe I can gain the structured guidance necessary to achieve my ambitious goals.</p>
        <p>AltSchool Africa represents a pivotal opportunity for me to realize my dream: whish is basically leveraging localized software for the good of society. My involvement with various Web3 projects has shown me how real-life issues are being tackled, and I now deeply understand how modern internet technology can uplift vital, often overlooked, sectors in developing countries. </p>
        <p>At AltSchool's School of Engineering, I have the goal of acquiring a robust foundation in software development, including proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and practical application development. I am particularly eager to delve into mastering backend software development technologies to build comprehensive, user centric solutions.<br> This structured learning environment will provide the clarity and depth I lacked in my self-taught attempts, transforming my raw ambition into tangible technical skills.</p>
        <p>I truly see myself playing an active role in creating these solutions, not just in the distant future, but even during my learning process at AltSchool. My background in agriculture, combined with the engineering expertise I will gain at the school of engineering, gives me a unique advantage in identifying practical software applications.<br> I envision developing tools for improving agricultural supply chains and platforms tailored for farmers and rural communities in Nigeria.<br> The practical, project-based learning approach at AltSchool will be instrumental in allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, fostering a problem-solving mindset crucial for an impactful engineering career.</p>
        <p>My time at AltSchool Africa School of Engineering will be a game-changer. The curriculum, coupled with the collaborative community and potential mentorship, will accelerate my development exponentially, providing real-world experience that is crucial for a successful career in tech. This powerful combination of academic learning, practical application, and expert guidance will empower me to better serve my local community and other neglected communities across Nigeria.<br> My lived experiences won't just be stories; they'll provide a rock-solid foundation to genuinely understand and address the specific, often ignored, needs of neglected sectors in the developing world. For me, AltSchool Africa is not just an educational opportunity; it's an investment in a future where my personal resilience and newfound technical prowess converge to create tangible solutions for the communities that need them most.</p>
